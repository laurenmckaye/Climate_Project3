# Climate Project
## Purpose
Here is the prompt for this project: "Your goal is to ask and answer an interesting question using the data. I want a written report that provides motivation for your question, graphs that help analyze your question, and written analysis.The style should be that of a research paper, although you can be far less rigorous."

I have decided to explore the wind levels of cities on the shores of Lake Michigan to determine if Chicago is aptly named "The Windy City"

## Data
To answer this question I employed data from 2014-2024 provided by the National Center for Enviornmental Information, speicifically using the Local Climatological Data (LCD). The stations I chose were Chicago, Milwaukee, Ludington, and Manitowoc. The csv files would not upload correctly to github so here is a link to the files used: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16Cooy5VrZ8Co4oYGHiH45fhOVJ35gnTA?usp=sharing

## Usage
This code is able to be run through Python.
